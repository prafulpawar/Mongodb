# What is Database?
A database is an organized, collection of data designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and management by users or applications.

## Why Use Databases?

1. **Organized Data Storage**: 
   Efficiently store and structure data for easy access and management.

2. **Efficient Data Retrieval**: 
   Retrieve and process data quickly, even from large datasets, using powerful query capabilities.

3. **Data Consistency and Integrity**: 
   Maintain accuracy and reliability of data with rules like constraints and keys.

4. **Security**: 
   Protect sensitive data with authentication, encryption, and access controls.

5. **Scalability**: 
   Handle growing data and user demands by scaling vertically or horizontally.

6. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   Databases decouple data storage from application logic, ensuring clean architecture and modularity. 
   For example, a backend server focuses on business logic while the database manages data storage and retrieval.
