**Understanding MongoDB Shell (`mongosh`) and Node.js Version Detection**

### **What is `mongosh`?**
`mongosh` (MongoDB Shell) is the modern, interactive command-line interface for MongoDB. It replaces the old `mongo` shell and is built on Node.js, providing enhanced features and improved integration with MongoDB's ecosystem.

### **Why Does `process.version` Show Node.js Version in `mongosh`?**
When you run `mongo --nodb` and execute `process.version`, and it returns a Node.js version (e.g., `v20.11.1`), it indicates that you are using **`mongosh`**, which runs on a **Node.js engine**.

### **Differences Between `mongosh` and the Classic `mongo` Shell**

#### **MongoDB Shell (`mongosh`)**
- **Runs on Node.js**, enabling access to Node.js features.
- Executes JavaScript commands in a Node.js environment.
- Supports improved scripting capabilities and modern JavaScript syntax.
- Used in **MongoDB 5.x and later** as the default shell.

#### **MongoDB Classic Shell (`mongo`)**
- **Does not run on Node.js**, using a standalone JavaScript interpreter.
- Limited to MongoDB-specific commands and JavaScript execution.
- No access to Node.js global objects like `process.version`.
- Deprecated in favor of `mongosh`.

### **How to Check Which Shell You Are Using?**
To determine whether you are using `mongosh` or the classic `mongo` shell, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```sh
   mongo --nodb
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   mongosh --nodb
   ```

2. Once inside the shell, check the version by executing:
   ```js
   process.version
   ```

#### **Interpreting the Output:**
- **If a Node.js version appears** (e.g., `v20.11.1`), then you are using **`mongosh`**.
- **If an error occurs**, then you are using the **classic `mongo` shell**.

---

### **Solution: Using the Old MongoDB Shell (`mongo`)**
If you do not want to use the Node.js-based `mongosh` and prefer the classic `mongo` shell:
1. **Ensure the classic `mongo` shell is installed**
   - MongoDB versions **5.x and later** default to `mongosh`.
   - To use the old `mongo` shell, you may need to install **MongoDB Tools** or an older MongoDB version.

2. **Explicitly run the classic shell:**
   ```sh
   mongo --nodb
   ```

Using **`mongosh` enables Node.js features**, which is why running `process.version` returns a Node.js version. If you prefer a traditional MongoDB experience, you can use the classic `mongo` shell instead.
